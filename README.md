## Forecasting Greenhouse Gas Emissions, GDP, and Surface Temperature Anomalies

**Overview**

This project analyzes the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), GDP growth, and surface temperature anomalies over time. Leveraging regression forecasting models, I aim to uncover trends and make predictions on future climate and economic conditions.

**Goals**

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between GHG emissions, GDP, and surface temperature anomalies.
* Apply time series analysis using regression models to forecast future trends.
* Visualize the relationships and future projections using Seaborn and Plotly.

**Technologies & Tools**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization.
* scikit-learn for regression modeling.
* Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and documentation.

**Data Sources**

* Greenhouse Gas Emissions data from [tbd]
* Global GDP data from [tbd]
* Surface Temperature Anomalies data from [tbd]

**Next Steps**

* Complete EDA on the dataset to highlight correlations and trends.
* Implement time series forecasting models using ARIMA, SARIMA, or Regression.
* Publish visualizations and insights to GitHub Pages and Substack.
